### Controller
- A component that acts as an intermediary between user requests and backend services, handling HTTP requests
and returning an HTTP response as part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
### RequestMapping
- An annotation used to map HTTP requests to specific methods in a controller, allowing
for precise handling of incoming requests.
### PostConstruct
- is used to indicate a method that should be executed after the object has been constructed and its dependencies
injected, for performing post-initialization tasks.
### GetMapping
- By using @GetMapping, developers can specify the desired behavior for HTTP GET requests in a more straightforward and readable manner, making the code easier to maintain and understand. 
When a GET request is received, Spring will automatically look for a method annotated with @GetMapping that matches the requested URL, and if found, execute that method to handle the request and return the appropriate response.




### HTML
- GET requests retrieve data from a specified resource.
- POST requests submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
- PUT requests update a current resource with new data.
- PATCH requests perform partial updates to a current resource.
- DELETE requests delete a specified resource.
